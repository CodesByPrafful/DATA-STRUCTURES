Data Structures Programs Repository

📌 Overview:

This repository contains seven fundamental programs related to Data Structures. These programs cover essential concepts of Stacks and Queues, including variations such as Circular Queue and Double-Ended Queue. Additionally, the repository includes question-based practice programs to enhance problem-solving skills.

📂 Programs Included:

PROGRAM 1 - Circular Queue (Implementation of a circular queue with enqueue and dequeue operations).

PROGRAM 1 - Double Ended Queue OR Dequeue (A queue where elements can be added or removed from both ends).

PROGRAM 1 - PrintJobs (A problem-solving exercise based on the normal queue structure).

PROGRAM 1 - Queue (Standard queue implementation with basic operations).

PROGRAM 1 - Stack (Basic stack implementation using an array or linked list).

PROGRAM 1 - Stack Question Practice 1 (Stack-based problem-solving exercise).

PROGRAM 1 - Stack Question Practice 2 (Another stack-based practice question for better understanding).

🛠️ Technologies Used:

1. Programming Language: Java 

2. Data Structures: Stack, Queue, Deque, Circular Queue

🚀 How to Run the Programs:

1. Clone this repository using:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

cd repository-name

3. Compile and run the desired program (modify as per language used):

javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName

📖 Learning Outcomes:

1. Understanding different types of queues (Normal, Circular, and Double-Ended Queue).

2. Mastering stack operations and their applications.

3. Improving problem-solving skills with queue and stack-based practice problems.
